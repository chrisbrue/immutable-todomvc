# immutable-todomvc
Todo MVC example using React, Flux and ImmutableJS

During the [React.js Conference](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/02/18/react-conf-roundup-2015.html) in January 2015, [Lee Byron](https://github.com/leebyron) presented a talk, [Immutable Data and React](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7IdS-PbEgI), based on his work around [ImmutableJS](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/).

Near the end he presented an example how one could incorporate the concepts of [ImmutableJS](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/), [PureRenderMixin](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/pure-render-mixin.html) and history into the [React TodoMVC](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/tree/gh-pages/examples/react-backbone) originally created by [Pete Hunt](https://github.com/petehunt).

This example provides a more complete solution of Lee's demo and is based on the [Flux TodoMVC](https://github.com/facebook/flux/tree/master/examples/flux-todomvc) created by [Bill Fisher](https://github.com/fisherwebdev).  It incorporates the following: React, Flux, ImmutableJS and [PureRenderMixin](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/pure-render-mixin.html).
